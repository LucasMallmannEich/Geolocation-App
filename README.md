# Geolocation-App

- With the help of the Yelp Platarform, I was able to create an app which allows the user to search for any kind of services, such as restaurants, dentists and accountants.         
- The user of the app is able to type the service and it's city for the search.        
- In response, the app shows a list and a map with all the establishments (results of the search) in that city.

  Here is how the app look like:
  
  At first, the app set the location to a random city, and gives the user the search box to choose the word and city.

  After the user fill the search boxes, he has to press "enter" or press the button "enter" of the keyboard.

  As a result of that, is shown to him a list and a map with the places that attend to it's specifications (word and city).

  Also, the user can navigate through the city using the map object in the right.
